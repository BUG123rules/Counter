  <h1>I Made a Poem Expressing My Love For you</h1>  
  
  
  <br>

  <p>
    I have tried many times to contain my love for you with words. Every time it has proven impossible.
    Still I try, to even begin to convey my love for you.<br><br>Your smile could pierce through any cloudy
    day. The way you come closer when you need comfort. The way you look at me when you want me to explain 
    something further. The way you snuggle uo close when you have a fun story to tell. How invested you get 
    into all of your interestes. I love everything about you. To desribe it all would take longer than a lifetime.
    Longer than a thousnad lifetimes. Longer than a million. Every single part of you is incredible. everything
    you do inspires me. I could never understand how anyoen sees anything besides greatness in you. You are truly
    perfect. In every single way. I cannot wait to spend forever and ever with you. Even when things occasionally
    get hard. We make it through. And my love for you will never ever waver. Even in teh face of the end of the world.
    Through every singel hardship. Every second with you is worth a thousnad years of pain to experience. You 
    are worth every single thing in the world. I would go through all of hell for as long as it takes if it just 
    affords me a singel moment with you. You are worth the world.<br><br>I love you Jameson. Never forget that.
